you could change the parameters for kernel in the code "fix_train_update_kernel_idealKer.m"
for example you could change parameter as following for PLKL
"% Parameter setting
Cck = 1e4;  sigma1 = 0.25;  sigma2 = 2;  % SVM-CK
wopt = 9;  mu = 0.8;  gamma = 1e1;
mu_wm=0.1; gamma_wm=1e0;"
WHEN you test time you could replace the pinv(K) as invK = inv(K+1e-5*eye(size(K))) for kwir (OA_SVMid) it's more effective

the consistency voting code for auxiliary training set augmentation is in code "fix_kernel_update_train_bagging_mean_ck.m" 

K_whole_mss_indianbestSig_consider0.mat and vector_pos_to_union_all_index.mat is data generated by code (backup_codes/consider0_compute_mean_spatial_kernel_whole_indian)
